# Universal Apple Store Search (Babel Edition)

This is a fully functional app demonstrating latest best practices in Angular,
using Babel/ES2015 and jspm. The backend is [Apple's Search API][apple api].

You can [see the app in action][app].

## Primary Technologies

* Transpiles ES2015+ automagically using [Babel][]
* Package management using [jspm][]
* Develop and build using [Gulp][] and friends


## Major Concepts Demonstrated

* Uses [UI Router][] for state based and nested routing
* Uses jspm instead of Bower or npm to manage packages for the browser
* Uses [SystemJS][] to load modules
* Sass compilation using [LibSass][] and [Autoprefixer][]
* Local dev server with [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) using
    [Browsersync][]
* Define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors using
    [EditorConfig][]
* Linting with [ESLint][]
* Gulp tasks are written using ES2015, of course.
* Multiple `serve` modes to facilitate development speed or simulate production
    environment.
* Per environment setting determined at build time.


## Usage

1. Fork and clone this repo from
    `https://github.com/gsong/apple-store-search.git`.
2. Make sure you have `node` installed on your machine. [nvm][] is highly
   recommended.
3. Install Gulp and jspm globally: `npm install -g gulp jspm`.
4. `npm install` then `jspm install` to instal development and browser packages.
5. Run `gulp` to start the local dev server.
6. Make your own enhancements! üòÄ


## Building and Publishing

1. Run `gulp dist` to build the app for distribution in the `/dist` folder.
2. Run `gulp publish` to publish the app on `gh-pages` branch.


## Hint

Use [gulper][] if you want to automatically reload the Gulp runtime whenever you
change Gulp task files. This is especially nice if you're customizing the task
files to fit your own workflow. Otherwise you would have to constantly restart
gulp.


## Contributing

1. Pick something from [TODO][] to work on.
2. If there's a problem, please file a [new issue][], or better yet, submit a
   [pull request][]!
